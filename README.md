In this project web3 javascript library is used along with the solidity language. I have deployed a fairly basic smart contract onto the rinkeby test network. It is deployed at address 0x44DB4F776e837f4C2076710Ff4b00bd5EaDb0839.

I first tested the contract on the ganache local network and wrote tests using the mocha test framework. Then I used truffle's HDWaleetProvider as a provider and the Infura API to connect to the rinkeby test network.
